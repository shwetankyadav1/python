    "- The RESTful Web APIs are a quasi-standard method of performing actions using or exchanging data with web-connected services\n",
    "  - e.g. Retrieve list of repositories from GitHub\n",
    "  - e.g. Using GPT-4 to process datasets automatically\n",
    "  - e.g. Starting and stopping a container hosted on Microsoft Azure\n",
    "- REST: “Representational State Transfer”\n",
    "  - Uses HTTP requests: GET, POST, (PUT), (DELETE)\n",
    "  - Generally, returns data in machine-readable formats like JSON\n",
    "- Uniform interface\n",
    "  - Every entity (piece of data) is generally retrieved from the same URI\n",
    "- Client-server decoupling\n",
    "  - The web interface is assumed to be the only link between the client and the server\n",
    "  - Data isn’t getting passed through a separate channel (e.g. file on hard drive)\n",
    "- Statelessness\n",
    "  - All required information is included in the request\n",
    "  - Identity is established on every request (usually via a secret token)\n",
